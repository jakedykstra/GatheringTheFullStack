## Where to Start
It's easy to say harder to do. My advice, start with the basics. Learn JavaScript/CSS/HTML front and back and begin work on projects.

## What it takes (This is what I'm reviewing. It's a specific stack I've chosen to use. For rationale please refer here.
- Clean Code
  - Implement strong naming and follow design patterns
- Front-End
  - Understand the Basics - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Know how to implement SPA - React, ReactRouter
  - Use state management - Redux
  - Send AJAX requests - GraphQL/ApolloClient
  - Use Static Type - TypeScript
  - Implement a precompiler for styling - SCSS
  - Unit Test - Jest with Enzyme
  - Handle 0Auth - NPM Packages (react-facebook-login/react-google-login)
  - Use a linter - TSLint
- Back-End
  - Know Node
  - Know your database. Choose SQL - MySQL/Sequelize
  - Pick a framework - Express
  - Handle API's - GraphQL
  - Authorization - PassportJS
  - Have a checker - TravisCI
- Deployment
  - Contain your application - Docker
